# DFT_GPAW_NRR
This repository contains the GPAW code to run density functional theory (DFT) calculations to calculate the energy profile of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). It contains a dataset of the adsorption energy of nitrogen adatom for transition metal-based alloys. Also, the characteristics of the d-band of the electrocatalyst such as the center, width, and filling are calculated. The adsorption energy of the nitrogen adatom and the characteristics of the d-band of the electrocatalyst is used to train a machine-learning algorithm that predicts the theoretical overpotential of the NRR. This approach allows to estimate the NRR overpotential on the surface of the electrocatalyst with different surface structures, without the need to calculate the energy profile of the NRR with DFT.
