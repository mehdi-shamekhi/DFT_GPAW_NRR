# DFT_GPAW_NRR
This repository contains the GPAW code to run density functional theory (DFT) calculations to calculate the energy profile of the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Moreover, it contains a dataset of the adsorption energy of nitrogen adatom along with the characteristics of the density of states of the electrocatalyst. The adsorption energy of the nitrogen adatom along with the characteristics of the d-band of the electrocatalyst is used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts the theoretical overpotential of the NRR
