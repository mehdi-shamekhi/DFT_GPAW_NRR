# DFT_GPAW_NRR
This repository contains the GPAW code to run density functional theory calculations to calculate the energy profile of the nitrogen reduction reaction. Moreover, it contains a dataset of adsorption energy of nitrogen adatom along with the characteristics of the density of states of the electrocatalyst.
